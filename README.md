# README

This project was created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#overview)

It used the `final-folder` from [chrisblakely01/quiz-app](https://github.com/chrisblakely01/quiz-app.git)

I actually simply modernized it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### install

```bash
npm install
```

### start app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `build`

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Lets checkit out
In the `.python` folder, run the `upload.py` file to upload the assets to the react folder.
